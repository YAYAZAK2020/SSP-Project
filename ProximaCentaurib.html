                <h1>Proxima Centauri b</h1>
                <p><b>Proxima Centauri b</b> is an exoplanet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Sun. It was discovered in 2016 and is the closest exoplanet to Earth.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b> <abbr title="Super-Earth is a reference only to an exoplanet's size which is larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune.">Super-Earth</abbr></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Mass:</b> Estimated to be around 1.3 times the mass of Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Radius:</b> Estimated to be around 1.2 times the radius of Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period:</b> 11.18 days</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Estimated to be within its star's habitable zone, with a potential for liquid water on its surface.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Far from Earth:</b> 4.2 light-years</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Significance of its discovery</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Closest exoplanet to Earth:</b> Proxima Centauri b is the nearest known exoplanet to Earth, making it a prime target for future exploration and research.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Potential for habitability:</b> Its location within its star's habitable zone and similar mass to Earth make it a promising candidate for supporting life.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Implications for extraterrestrial life:</b> The discovery of Proxima Centauri b has fueled speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of other habitable planets in our galaxy.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun. This red dwarf star is located 4.2 light-years - or 40 trillion kilometers - away from Earth. An exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, was detected orbiting this star in 2016.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Proxima Centauri b is a rocky planet that is a bit larger than Earth. Like Kepler-22b, it is also located in its star's habitable zone. Scientists find this exoplanet very intriguing, but they will have to continue studying it from afar - even using the fastest space probe ever built, the Parker Solar Probe which could travel at speeds of up to 724,000 km/h, it would take almost 7000 years to reach Proxima Centauri b!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In 2020, scientists confirmed the existence of a second planet in this system: Proxima Centauri c. This super-Earth or mini-Neptune is about 7 times as massive as our planet but orbits its star beyond the habitable zone.</li>
