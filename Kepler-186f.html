                <h1>Kepler-186f</h1>
                <p><b>Kepler-186f</b> is a significant exoplanet discovery due to its similarity to Earth.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b>The exact composition of Kepler-186f is unknown, but it's believed to be a rocky planet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Mass:</b> It's the first Earth-sized planet discovered in the <abbr title="Is a zone far from its star around 1 AU (the average distance between the Earth and our sun)."> habitable zone</abbr> of another star. This means it could potentially support liquid water on its surface.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Location:</b> It orbits Kepler-186, a red dwarf star located about 490 light-years from Earth.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period: </b>130 days.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> While it's within the habitable zone, its temperature is likely lower than Earth's due to its star being a <abbr title="A small star and doesn't emmite alot of heat compared to other stars.">red dwarf</abbr>.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Composition:</b></li>
