                <p><b>K2-124 b</b> K2-124 b is a hot super-Earth exoplanet orbiting the star K2-124. It's one of the first exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b> <abbr title="Super-Earth's larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. This makes it a member of the 'super-Earth' category of exoplanets.">Super-Earth</abbr></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Transiting:</b> K2-124 b passes in front of its star as seen from Earth; a phenomenon known as "transiting." This allows astronomers to measure its size and atmospheric properties.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period:</b> 1.5 days</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> K2-124 b orbits extremely close to its star, making it incredibly hot. Its surface temperature is estimated to be thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Significance of its discovery</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Understanding exoplanets:</b> K2-124 b has been a valuable target for studying exoplanets. Its extreme conditions provide insights into the diversity of planetary systems beyond our own.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Atmospheric studies:</b> Scientists have attempted to study the atmosphere of K2-124 b to learn more about its composition and potential for habitability. However, due to its extreme heat, it's unlikely to be habitable.</li>
