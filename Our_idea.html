            <p>We have developed a game that contains multiple levels. This game is designed for students in elementary and preparatory schools, featuring a rocket that tries to escape from some asteroids with increasing difficulty. After escaping the asteroids, the rocket should reach one of the exoplanets (planets outside our solar system). We have also developed a website as a resource for this game. The website shows the location of various exoplanets in space, and when a user clicks on an exoplanet, the website displays the main information about that planet, along with an animation video for children. In this video, the exoplanet described itself. We created these resources to help children better understand the concept of exoplanets.</p>
