                <h1>Proxima Centauri d</h1>
                <p><b>Proxima Centauri d</b> is a newly discovered exoplanet orbiting <abbr title="The nearest star to our Sun.">Proxima Centauri</abbr>. It was announced in February 2023 and is the third known planet in the <abbr title="In this system there are 3 planets (Proxima Centauri b, d, and c)">Proxima Centauri system</abbr>.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b> <abbr title="Super-Earth is a reference only to an exoplanet's size which is larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune.">Super-Earth</abbr></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Mass:</b> Estimated to be around 2.5 times the mass of Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period:</b> Approximately 5.12 days</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Likely too hot to be habitable, with an estimated surface temperature around 234 degrees Celsius (453 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>

                <h2>Significance of its discovery</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Additional planet in the Proxima Centauri system:</b> The discovery of Proxima Centauri d adds to our understanding of the planetary system around Proxima Centauri, which could potentially host multiple habitable planets.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Challenges for detection: :</b> Proxima Centauri d is a challenging planet to detect due to its small size and <abbr title="Means that this planet is close to its star and measured by AU (Astronomical Unit -The average distance between the Earth and the sun-)">close proximity to its star</abbr>. Its discovery highlights the advancements in exoplanet detection techniques.</li>
