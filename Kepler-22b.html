                <h1>Kepler-22b</h1>
                <p><b>Kepler-22b</b> is a <abbr title="Super-Earth is a reference only to an exoplanet's size which is larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune.">super-Earth exoplanet</abbr> orbiting the Sun-like star Kepler-22. It was discovered in 2011 by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope and is one of the most promising candidates for a potentially habitable planet outside our solar system.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b> Super-Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Mass:</b> Estimated to be around 2.4 times the mass of Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Radius:</b> Estimated to be around 2.4 times the radius of Earth</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period:</b> 289.85 days</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Estimated to be around 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit), potentially within the habitable zone of its star</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Eccentricity:</b> <abbr title="its orbit is nearly circular, with a very slight deviation from a perfect circle">0.034 </abbr></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Gravity:</b> 0.9 <abbr title="The gravity of Earth = 9.8N">g</abbr></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Far from Earth:</b> 600 light-years</li>

                <h2>Significance of its discovery</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Potential for habitability:</b> Kepler-22b's estimated temperature and location within its star's habitable zone make it a promising candidate for supporting liquid water on its surface.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>First confirmed planet in the habitable zone:</b> Kepler-22b was the first confirmed exoplanet to be located within the habitable zone of a Sun-like star.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Implications for planetary formation:</b> The discovery of 51 Pegasi b challenged existing theories of planetary formation, as it suggested that gas giants could form closer to their stars than previously thought.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Implications for extraterrestrial life:</b> The discovery of Kepler-22b has fueled speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of other habitable planets in our galaxy.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Roughly twice the size of Earth, Kepler-22b was discovered in 2011 by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanet was the first to be found in any star's habitable zone.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Although scientists are unsure what Kepler-22b looks like, the exoplanet orbits its star at just the right distance - where a planet is most likely to have a climate that would allow any water on its surface to remain liquid.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>This area is also called the Goldilocks Zone, since the conditions are not too hot, not too cold, but just right. However, there are no guarantees that this exoplanet, located about 600 light-years away from Earth, hosts alien life, or that humans could live on it.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li> Its location within its star's habitable zone suggests that it could potentially support liquid water, we don't have direct evidence to confirm this.</li>
