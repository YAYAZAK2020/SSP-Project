                <h1>51 Pegasi b</h1>
                <p><b>51 Pegasi b</b> was the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a <abbr title="similar to our Sun.">main-sequence star.</abbr> Also, the first <abbr title="aka hot saturns. It's a gas giant exoplanets that are physically similar to Jupiter but have very short orbital periods -less than 10 days-">Hot Jupiter</abbr> ever observed. Its discovery in 1995 marked a significant milestone in the field of exoplanet research, confirming the existence of planets outside our solar system.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Type:</b> Gas giant</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Mass:</b> Approximately 0.46 times the mass of Jupiter</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Radius:</b> About 1.5 times the radius of Jupiter</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Orbital period:</b> 4.23 days</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Very hot, with a surface temperature estimated around 1000 degrees Celsius (1832 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Far from Earth:</b> 50 light-years</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Significance of its discovery</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pioneering discovery:</b>51 Pegasi b was the first exoplanet discovered around a Sun-like star, revolutionizing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Hot Jupiter class:</b> Its close orbit and high temperature led to the classification of "hot Jupiter," a category of gas giant exoplanets that orbit their stars at very short distances.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Implications for planetary formation:</b> The discovery of 51 Pegasi b challenged existing theories of planetary formation, as it suggested that gas giants could form closer to their stars than previously thought.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Discovery:</b> 51 Pegasi b's discovery in 1995 by Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz surprised the scientific community since models of planetary formation at the time did not predict its existence. The pair later won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for their achievement.</li>
